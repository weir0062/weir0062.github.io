        <h2>Artemis IV mission to the moon in VR </h2>
        <p> In my last year of GameDev, i was lucky enough to be on the team of students chosen to do a virtual reality version of the Arthemis IV space launch. We worked on this project for 8 months,
             with on-site work at the museum multiple times a week. I was one of the three programmers on the team and my responsibilities included:
            <br> -Designed and programmed main menu.
            <br> -Designed and programmed in-game tablet menu.
            <br>  -Developed gravity controller.
            <br> -Designed and implemented fader.
            <br> -Developed sound on collision system.
            <br> -Added Haptic Feedback to controllers.
            <br> -Resolved UI issues and implemented improvements for optimal UX.</p>

        <h2>Stealth level</h2>
        <p> This stealth game project was an opportunity for me to sharpen my programming skills and showcase my expertise in game development.
            I designed and implemented advanced AI path-following algorithms, which included basic save and load functionality, 
            seamless animation transitions, and smooth third-person camera movements. 
            One of the unique features of the game is the "danger zone" mechanic,
            which I coded entirely in shader language for improved performance and graphical fidelity.
            By utilizing my proficiency in both C# and shader programming,
            I was able to create a proof-of-concept that highlights 
            my technical abilities and attention to detail.</p>

        <h2>Snake Game Plugin</h2>
        <p> This Snake game is a demonstration of my skills in utilizing external libraries and plugins.
            streamline the gameplay mechanics and optimize performance, 
            wrote a custom plugin in C++ that manages all the movement and collision detection in real-time.
            This involved designing and implementing custom algorithms that suit the requirements of the game.
            By utilizing this plugin, I was able to create a classic snake game.</p>
