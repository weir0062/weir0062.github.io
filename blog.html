        <h2>Artemis IV mission to the moon in VR </h2>
        <p> In my last year of GameDev, i was lucky enough to be on the team of students chosen to do a virtual reality version of the Arthemis IV space launch. We worked on this project for 8 months,
             with on-site work at the museum multiple times a week. I was one of the three programmers on the team and my responsibilities included:
            <br> -Designed and programmed main menu.
            <br> -Designed and programmed in-game tablet menu.
            <br>  -Developed gravity controller.
            <br> -Designed and implemented fader.
            <br> -Developed sound on collision system.
            <br> -Added Haptic Feedback to controllers.
            <br> -Resolved UI issues and implemented improvements for optimal UX.</p>

      <h2>Grapple Heroes, a multiplayer race with grapple guns </h2>
      <p> After my last year of GameDev, me and a few fellow graduates worked on a multiplayer race game, in which you had to get to the objective first, 
        while avoiding all of the obstacles in your way. In order to get to the objective, you will need to grapple to special points,
         using either the grappling towards, or the swing functionality.
         The combination of the two make for a very entertaining, yet challenging competition. I was one of the three programmers on the team and my responsibilities included:
         <br> -Designed and Developed initial Game Design 
         <br> -Integrated all of the grappling functionality( Swing/Pull towards/Crosshair)  
         <br> -Integrated all of the animations  
         <br> -Integrated all of the camera functionality 
         <br> -Created Shader for non playable areas 
         <br> -Developed some of the interactions

        <h2>Stealth level</h2>
        <p> This stealth game project was an opportunity for me to sharpen my programming skills and showcase my expertise in game development.
            I designed and implemented advanced AI path-following algorithms, which included basic save and load functionality, 
            seamless animation transitions, and smooth third-person camera movements. 
            One of the unique features of the game is the "danger zone" mechanic,
            which I coded entirely in shader language for improved performance and graphical fidelity.
            By utilizing my proficiency in both C# and shader programming,
            I was able to create a proof-of-concept that highlights 
            my technical abilities and attention to detail.</p>

        <h2>Snake Game Plugin</h2>
        <p> This Snake game is a demonstration of my skills in utilizing external libraries and plugins.
            streamline the gameplay mechanics and optimize performance, 
            wrote a custom plugin in C++ that manages all the movement and collision detection in real-time.
            This involved designing and implementing custom algorithms that suit the requirements of the game.
            By utilizing this plugin, I was able to create a classic snake game.</p>
